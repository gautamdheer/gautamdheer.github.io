                Exchange (which include its agents and employees), and (where
                appropriate) our partners and subcontractors in order to be able to
                provide the full range of the Services to Player. Player’s
                Information is collected when Player registers to open an account
                with Anna Exchange; or when Player submits a written query to Anna
                Exchange.
