            <p>
                Persons under the 18 years old are not allowed to use any of the
                Company's services and websites. The Company reserves the right to
                ask players for their age verification information and to suspend
                the player's account until he/she provides information that verifies
                appropriate age. All players must provide the Company with the proof
                of identity and evidence that he/she is at least 18 years old or
                above. (valid ID, Passport or Driving License or any other valid
                document, plus evidence of residence). Players are not allowed to
                make deposits and (or) place bets until the Procedure is finished
                and their age is verified. Failure to provide the Company with valid
                ID. Passport or Driving License will lead to Player's account
                closure. To prevent underage individuals from logging into gambling
                sites as part of parental control or to enable self-exclusion when
                necessary, the Company recommends parents or guardians to install a
                reputable filtering software system, for example betblocker.org
                (free) or any other alternative such as gamban.com (free trial).

            <h1 class="text-2xl py-3">GAMING ADDICTION</h1>

            <p>
                Gambling is a socially acceptable form of recreational activity and,
                in many cases, classified as a harmless pastime. Nevertheless, as
                legalized gambling expands further, gambling-related problems pose a
                valid public health concern in susceptible individuals. The Company
                does not, under any circumstances, onboard players or continues a
                business relationship with those who suffer from or develop a
                gambling addiction and gambling-related disorders. The Company
                Responsible Gaming Policy framework serves as the foundation for
                identifying risky behaviour through a proprietary internal system.
                The system flags clients who experience repeated losses, are facing
                possible financial or mental health risks or who sound distressed
                and/or act abusively when communicating with the Company staff.
                These individuals contacted by Customer Service to assess the
                situation and to discuss activating self-limitation and/or
                self-exclusion options. Clients are regularly reminded about
                effective limit-setting tools such as spend limit, deposit limit,
                session time limit and given an option to personalize a
                limit-setting approach. Having a time-out to cool off temporarily
                anywhere from 1 day to 6 weeks is advisable to those who are
                predisposed to addictive behaviour, experience changes in personal
                circumstances or exhibit signs of mental illness.

            <h1 class="text-2xl py-3">SELF-EXCLUSION</h1>

            When playing occasionally stops being fun, turns into daily obsession
            and you find yourself unable to stop, it is the operator’s duty to
            recommend activating a voluntary self-exclusion option. We encourage
            you to contact our Support Team via email or chat and let us know you
            would like to stop using our website and all services for a certain
            period of time and stop receiving marketing or promotional materials
            from the operator and its affiliates. We encourage you to speak to a
            mental health professional at this point in order to gain control of
            your gambling habit or contact one of the problem gambling help
            centres, offering support and counselling such as Gambling Anonymous
            at www.gamblersanonymous.org.uk or Gambling Therapy at
            www.gamblingtherapy.org/ Being self-excluded means not being able to
            create a new gambling account with the Operator, wager or gamble on
            your pre-existing account and/or deposit funds.

            <h1 class="text-2xl py-3">OPERATOR ACTIONS</h1>

                excessive dependence on gambling, as per Client Care’s assessment
                and recommendations. We reserve the right to keep accounts closed or
                deny a reactivation request, to ensure the safety of the player.
