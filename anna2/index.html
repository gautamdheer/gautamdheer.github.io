                    Persons under the 18 years old are not allowed to use any of the
                    Company's services and websites. The Company reserves the right to
                    ask players for their age verification information and to suspend
                    the player's account until he/she provides information that verifies
                    appropriate age. All players must provide the Company with the proof
                    of identity and evidence that he/she is at least 18 years old or
                    above. (valid ID, Passport or Driving License or any other valid
                    document, plus evidence of residence). Players are not allowed to
                    make deposits and (or) place bets until the Procedure is finished
                    and their age is verified. Failure to provide the Company with valid
                    ID. Passport or Driving License will lead to Player's account
                    closure. To prevent underage individuals from logging into gambling
                    sites as part of parental control or to enable self-exclusion when
                    necessary, the Company recommends parents or guardians to install a
                    reputable filtering software system, for example betblocker.org
                    (free) or any other alternative such as gamban.com (free trial).

                <p>
                    Gambling is a socially acceptable form of recreational activity and,
                    in many cases, classified as a harmless pastime. Nevertheless, as
                    legalized gambling expands further, gambling-related problems pose a
                    valid public health concern in susceptible individuals. The Company
                    does not, under any circumstances, onboard players or continues a
                    business relationship with those who suffer from or develop a
                    gambling addiction and gambling-related disorders. The Company
                    Responsible Gaming Policy framework serves as the foundation for
                    identifying risky behaviour through a proprietary internal system.
                    The system flags clients who experience repeated losses, are facing
                    possible financial or mental health risks or who sound distressed
                    and/or act abusively when communicating with the Company staff.
                    These individuals contacted by Customer Service to assess the
                    situation and to discuss activating self-limitation and/or
                    self-exclusion options. Clients are regularly reminded about
                    effective limit-setting tools such as spend limit, deposit limit,
                    session time limit and given an option to personalize a
                    limit-setting approach. Having a time-out to cool off temporarily
                    anywhere from 1 day to 6 weeks is advisable to those who are
                    predisposed to addictive behaviour, experience changes in personal
                    circumstances or exhibit signs of mental illness.

                    activities. In addition, you can visit

                </p>

                    <li>Use self-limitation tools</li>
                    <li>Stick to the thought that it is only a game!</li>
                    <li>
                        Take frequent breaks or alternate gambling with other activities
                    </li>
                    <li>Don't gamble when feeling bad, in stress or troubled</li>
                </ul>

                <h1 class="text-2xl py-3">SELF-EXCLUSION</h1>

                When playing occasionally stops being fun, turns into daily obsession
                and you find yourself unable to stop, it is the operator’s duty to
                recommend activating a voluntary self-exclusion option. We encourage
                you to contact our Support Team via email or chat and let us know you
                would like to stop using our website and all services for a certain
                period of time and stop receiving marketing or promotional materials
                from the operator and its affiliates. We encourage you to speak to a
                mental health professional at this point in order to gain control of
                your gambling habit or contact one of the problem gambling help
                centres, offering support and counselling such as Gambling Anonymous
                at www.gamblersanonymous.org.uk or Gambling Therapy at
                www.gamblingtherapy.org/ Being self-excluded means not being able to
                create a new gambling account with the Operator, wager or gamble on
                your pre-existing account and/or deposit funds.

                <h1 class="text-2xl py-3">OPERATOR ACTIONS</h1>

                <p>
                    The Operator reserves the right to impose exclusion on a player who
                    communicates erratically, shows signs of mental illness and exhibits
                    excessive dependence on gambling, as per Client Care’s assessment
                    and recommendations. We reserve the right to keep accounts closed or
                    deny a reactivation request, to ensure the safety of the player.
                    Problem gambling must be addressed immediately and we are here to
