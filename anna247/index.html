          <p>
            Persons under the 18 years old are not allowed to use any of the
            Company's services and websites. The Company reserves the right to
            ask players for their age verification information and to suspend
            the player's account until he/she provides information that verifies
            appropriate age. All players must provide the Company with the proof
            of identity and evidence that he/she is at least 18 years old or
            above. (valid ID, Passport or Driving License or any other valid
            document, plus evidence of residence). Players are not allowed to
            make deposits and (or) place bets until the Procedure is finished
            and their age is verified. Failure to provide the Company with valid
            ID. Passport or Driving License will lead to Player's account
            closure. To prevent underage individuals from logging into gambling
            sites as part of parental control or to enable self-exclusion when
            necessary, the Company recommends parents or guardians to install a
            reputable filtering software system, for example betblocker.org
            (free) or any other alternative such as gamban.com (free trial).
          </p>

          <h1 class="text-2xl py-3">GAMING ADDICTION</h1>

          <p>
            Gambling is a socially acceptable form of recreational activity and,
            in many cases, classified as a harmless pastime. Nevertheless, as
            legalized gambling expands further, gambling-related problems pose a
            valid public health concern in susceptible individuals. The Company
            does not, under any circumstances, onboard players or continues a
            business relationship with those who suffer from or develop a
            gambling addiction and gambling-related disorders. The Company
            Responsible Gaming Policy framework serves as the foundation for
            identifying risky behaviour through a proprietary internal system.
            The system flags clients who experience repeated losses, are facing
            possible financial or mental health risks or who sound distressed
            and/or act abusively when communicating with the Company staff.
            These individuals contacted by Customer Service to assess the
            situation and to discuss activating self-limitation and/or
            self-exclusion options. Clients are regularly reminded about
            effective limit-setting tools such as spend limit, deposit limit,
            session time limit and given an option to personalize a
            limit-setting approach. Having a time-out to cool off temporarily
            anywhere from 1 day to 6 weeks is advisable to those who are
            predisposed to addictive behaviour, experience changes in personal
            circumstances or exhibit signs of mental illness.
          </p>

          <h1 class="text-2xl py-3">SELF-CONTROL</h1>

          <p>
            Compulsive gambling is a real issue and we encourage clients to take
            a test to estimate the degree of your involvement with gambling
            activities. In addition, you can visit
            http://www.gamblersanonymous.org/ga/content/20-questions for
            additional testing and further information on virtual and in person
            meetings around the world.
          </p>

          <p class="py-4">
            Here’s some tips how you can control your gambling:
          </p>
          <ul class="px-2">
            <li>Do not borrow money to gamble</li>
            <li>Decide on a loss budget before playing and stick to it</li>
            <li>Use self-limitation tools</li>
            <li>Stick to the thought that it is only a game!</li>
            <li>
              Take frequent breaks or alternate gambling with other activities
            </li>
            <li>Don't gamble when feeling bad, in stress or troubled</li>
          </ul>

          <h1 class="text-2xl py-3">SELF-EXCLUSION</h1>

          When playing occasionally stops being fun, turns into daily obsession
          and you find yourself unable to stop, it is the operator’s duty to
          recommend activating a voluntary self-exclusion option. We encourage
          you to contact our Support Team via email or chat and let us know you
          would like to stop using our website and all services for a certain
          period of time and stop receiving marketing or promotional materials
          from the operator and its affiliates. We encourage you to speak to a
          mental health professional at this point in order to gain control of
          your gambling habit or contact one of the problem gambling help
          centres, offering support and counselling such as Gambling Anonymous
          at www.gamblersanonymous.org.uk or Gambling Therapy at
          www.gamblingtherapy.org/ Being self-excluded means not being able to
          create a new gambling account with the Operator, wager or gamble on
          your pre-existing account and/or deposit funds.

          <h1 class="text-2xl py-3">OPERATOR ACTIONS</h1>

          <p>
            The Operator reserves the right to impose exclusion on a player who
            communicates erratically, shows signs of mental illness and exhibits
            excessive dependence on gambling, as per Client Care’s assessment
            and recommendations. We reserve the right to keep accounts closed or
            deny a reactivation request, to ensure the safety of the player.
            Problem gambling must be addressed immediately and we are here to
            offer our support, should you have questions or concerns.
